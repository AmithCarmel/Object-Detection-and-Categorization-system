# Object-Detection-and-Categorization-system
Developed and tested an object detection system in MATLAB, achieving improved accuracy through reduced false detections and duplicates across multiple scenarios. Ensured computational efficiency with processing times of 15.67–28.23 seconds, supporting active safety features like lane change assistance and collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles.
