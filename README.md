# Object-Detection-and-Categorization-system
Developed and tested an object detection system in MATLAB, achieving improved accuracy through reduced false detections and duplicates across multiple scenarios. Ensured computational efficiency with processing times of 15.67â€“28.23 seconds, supporting active safety features like lane change assistance and collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles.
